Platforms:
	Make it regeneratable in game, REMOVE PHYS from SPACE with DECONSTRUCTOR 
	Start varying shape? Maybe make a more interesting model (octagonal, hexagonal, whatever), ramps, etc

General:
	Implement debug printing stuff, its good stuff

Rendering:
	Change lighting to directional
	Temporary skybox for visualizing movement better





Future:
	Rainbow platforms?
	Geometric columns in a trippy 3d space (like stars, and shit)? Hexagons or octagons
	Getting rainbow colors in certain pattern or whatever maybe does something, maybe not
