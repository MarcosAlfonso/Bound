Platforms:
	Make it regeneratable in game, REMOVE PHYS from SPACE with DECONSTRUCTOR 

General:
	Implement debug printing stuff, its good stuff

Rendering:
	Change lighting to directional
	Fog Shader





Future:
	Rainbow platforms?
	Geometric columns in a trippy 3d space (like stars, and shit)? Hexagons or octagons
	Getting rainbow colors in certain pattern or whatever maybe does something, maybe not
